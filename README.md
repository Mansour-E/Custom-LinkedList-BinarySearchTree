# LinkedList & SearchTree Java Project

## Description
This Java project implements a custom data structure library including a **doubly linked list** and a **binary search tree**. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, abstract classes, interfaces, and custom data structure manipulation.

The main components are:

- **ListItem**: Abstract class representing an item in a list or tree.
- **Node**: Concrete implementation of `ListItem`.
- **NodeList**: Interface defining methods for managing lists or trees.
- **MyLinkedList**: Implementation of a doubly linked list with insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **SearchTree**: Implementation of a binary search tree with insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Features
- Add and remove items from the linked list and search tree.
- Traverse the structures and print their contents.
- Compare items for sorting within the structures.

## Usage
 git clone https://github.com/Mansour-E/Custom-LinkedList-BinarySearchTree.git
